Checking at variables/DFA relations (to check which shape is based on which variable or the other way around)


On of the problems is that we have more variables than observations e.g. 5*100 landmarks.
And then we could check which landmark contributes the most to this discrimination

Check the KLR package (ask Simone for the unpublished references)

Check out canonical variates that's the multi variate version of LDA

Check out LDA with PGLS (some published paper)
